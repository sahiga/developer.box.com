# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application performs a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.

In the case of Box, CORS comes into play when a web application tries to contact the Box APIs from a browser environment. The Box API enforces CORS on an app-by-app basis and by default does not send the right HTTP headers to allow your browser to complete the request.

<Message warning>

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or CORS is only applicable to Box API requests made by a web page using a browser, and it relies on the `HTTP Origin` header being passed along by the browser.

## Enabling CORS for your domain

To enable CORS for the domain your application runs on, head over to the developer console, select your application, and scroll down to the bottom of the "Configuration" panel to find the CORS Domains setting.

Add a comma separated list of all the origins that you expect your application to be making Box API requests from. Domains require the schema (`http` or `https`) and can include wildcards for subdomains, for example `*.example.com`.

## CORS-like Errors

Some browsers will return a CORS-like error, even when CORS is enabled for your application.

In these scenarios, an HTTP response code will often be included (for example `400` or `401`) which will provide further direction where you may want to focus troubleshooting.
