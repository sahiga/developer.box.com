# Direct Uploads

The most straightforward way to upload a file to Box is using a direct upload. Direct uploads are restricted to a maximum file size of `50MB` and upload a file by making 1 API call.

## Upload domain

Uploads to Box happen via a different domain (`upload.box.com`) than regular API calls. This is something to keep in mind when writing your own upload code. All the Box SDKs will take care of choosing the right domain for the right API call.
