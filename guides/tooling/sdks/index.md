<Message type="notice">

**Maintained:** Fully maintained projects are actively developed by Box. They receive the latest security updates and new features. For support with these projects please visit GitHub or [our Platform support forum][forum].

**API Parity**: Projects with full API parity are actively updated with all platform functionality as this becomes available on the Box Platform. Projects with partial API parity lack some functionality while we work on bringing these projects to full parity.
