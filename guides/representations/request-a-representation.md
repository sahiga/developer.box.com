# Request Desired Representation

To select a specific representation call the [`GET /files/:id`][get_files_id] endpoint with a [`X-Rep-Hints`][x-rep-hints]-header defining the required representation format.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
  -H "X-Rep-Hints: [pdf]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Multiple dimensions

Some formats will require the `dimensions` to be passed in to select a specific size. This can be achieved by appending the `dimensions` to the header.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
  -H "X-Rep-Hints: [jpg?dimensions=94x94]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Multiple representations

Multiple representations can be fetched by chaining the different types in the `X-Rep-Hints`-header.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
  -H "X-Rep-Hints: [pdf][jpg?dimensions=94x94]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The `url_template` in this response is an **opaque** URL. This URL format might change over time and no assumptions should be made about its format except for the presence of the `{+asset_path}` variable.
