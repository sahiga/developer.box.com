# Handle Skills Events

Within the application or site that is set up as your [invocation URL](guide://skills/invocation-url) you will generally need to handle two payloads:

* [Event Payload](guide://skills/handle/payload): The Box Skills notification when a new file is uploaded, copied, or moved to a folder that the Skill is set up on.
* [Metadata Payload](guide://skills/handle/metadata): The metadata payload that will need to be constructed and stored back on the original file in Box. The data that this request is comprised of will come from the file processing system, such as a machine learning system.
