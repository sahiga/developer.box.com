# Webhook Retries

Delivery of a webhook payload has failed when Box does not receive a response with a HTTP status code in the `200` to `299` range within 30 seconds of sending the payload.

When delivery of a webhook fails Box will resend it up to 10 times. The initial retry will take place 5 minutes after the failure and from there an exponential back-off strategy will be used to avoid overloading the destination server.

By using exponential back- off, Box will wait an increasingly longer time for every retry.

<Message type="notice">

Box will retry webhook deliveries up to 10 times. This number could be subject to change.
