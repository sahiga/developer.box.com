# Create Shared Link

Shared links may be created directly for file or folder resources to generate a read-only URL to permit users with the appropriate access level to view the content.

<Message type="notice">

You may only have one active shared link for a file or folder at any time.

</Message>

At minimum the information needed to create a shared link will be:

* The type of resource, either a file or folder.
* The ID of that resource.

Optionally when creating a shared link the following may be specified:

* The access level, which may be one of:
  * open: A public shared link. Anyone with the link may access the link.
  * company: Anyone within your enterprise may access the link.
  * collaboration: Anyone collaborated on the content may access the link.
* An expiration time when the shared link will automatically disable.
* A password required to access the resource.

<Message type="notice">

If an access level is not specified when creating a shared link it will use the default access level specified by the enterprise admin.
