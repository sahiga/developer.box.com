# Remove Shared Link

A shared link may be removed from a resource by calling the [update file](endpoint://put_files_id) or [update folder](endpoint://put_folders_id) endpoint and setting the `shared_link` value to `null`.

<Message type="warning">

If you delete the shared link and create a new one, the new shared link will have a different URL and users with the old URL will not be able to access the resource.
