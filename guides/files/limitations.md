# Limitations

A few limitations exists when working with files.

## 名前に関する制約事項

There are some restrictions to a file's name. Names containing non-printable ASCII characters, forward and backward slashes (`/`, `\`), and protected names like `.` and `..` are automatically sanitized by removing the non-allowed characters.
